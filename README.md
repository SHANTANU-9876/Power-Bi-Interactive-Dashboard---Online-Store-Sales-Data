# Power-Bi-Interactive-Dashboard---Online-Store-Sales-Data
This project aims to analyze the sales performance and customer behavior of an online retail store using Power BI. The dataset used includes transactional records from 2018, capturing key business dimensions such as sales, profit, quantity sold, customer locations, product categories, and payment modes.

Objectives:
To identify top-performing product categories and regions

Methodology:
Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was created with two main sheets:

Performance Dashboard – Focused on overall KPIs, sales & profit by category and region, and time-series trends.
Consumer Insights Dashboard – Highlighted category and payment breakdowns, quantity analysis, and regional distribution.

Filters and slicers were added for interactivity, enabling users to explore data by state, city, month, and payment mode. Summary cards, bar/line charts, and map visuals were used to present clear, actionable insights.
